# TODO

Fixes to work through. Each open item is worked in its own Paseo workspace (worktree off local `main`);
mark it done with its commit once merged into `main`.

## Open

## Done

- [x] **Slack: your own messages show as "Paseo Command" (App).** Our client mislabelled them: Slack posts
  them as you (user token, no `username`), but attaches the app's `bot_profile`, which `messageOf` took as
  `botName`. A message with a person behind it (`user`, not a `bot_message`) now shows that person in every
  route (post, history, threads, search, socket). Commit "Slack: your own messages sent through the app show
  as you, not as the app".
