# Paseo Command — local development

## User requirements

- Work locally. Do not publish, upload, stream build-room events, or send this project to phaser.io.
- Do not sign in to Phaser AE, reconnect an online project, reinstall its skill, or start its room streamer.
- The Phaser AE account was disconnected and its installed skill removed at the user’s request.
- Cached engine files under `phaser/` and `game/node_modules/` remain available for local builds. Do not edit the engine.
- The original `/Users/example/development/paseo-command` project is read only. Preserve its React UI; focus current development on the game world.
- When you need to ask the user a question, use the ask-question tool (`AskUserQuestion`) rather than asking in plain text.
- Anything you ask the user to review, such as a plan, description or summary, must be in your visible reply,
  never only in your reasoning: the user does not see your thoughts.

## Product and references

Paseo Command visualizes hosts, projects, workspaces and agents from the Paseo daemon.
The React app and official SDK API are in `web/`. The Atlas world is drawn by the macOS app in
`native/` (SpriteKit, under the React app in a WKWebView); its layout and art are in `rendering/`.
The user removed the Phaser renderers (the web Atlas and the Galaxy world): in a plain browser the
panels work and the map area says it is drawn by the macOS app. Do not add further worlds unless asked.
The user’s five supplied top-down illustrations guide the Atlas world: blue water,
parchment hex islands, project landmarks, workspace cottages, and model-colored robots (Claude orange,
ChatGPT/Codex white; other providers keep a stable colour of their own).
The attached illustrations are references, not full-screen backgrounds.
Real state must remain truthful: distinguish running, idle, completed/unread, approval,
question, failure and offline. Test daemon mutations against fake daemons only.
The Atlas uses generated painted sprites; it is not yet finished reference-quality art.

## Completing a feature

Once the requested feature or fix is implemented and validated, commit it (one commit per fix) and merge it into
local `main`. If working directly on `main`, commit the completed feature there.
Preserve unrelated work in the checkout.

Then, from the main checkout on `main`, rebuild the web app, restart its server and rebuild the macOS app:

```sh
npm run app:update   # app:build && app:restart && native:build
```

This is part of completing the feature. The restart preserves the app's saved port. Never quit, relaunch
or open the user's macOS app: it keeps running, its title bar shows "Update ready · ⌘R" once a newer
native build is on disk, and the user presses ⌘R when they want the new web and native builds (⌘R
reloads the page, and swaps in a newer native build in place, keeping the window and page).
Report the commit and whether the build and restart succeeded.
Keep this workflow local; do not push or publish.

## Commands

- `npm run app:install`: installs `rendering/` and `web/` dependencies.
- `npm run app:dev`: React UI, SDK API and the Atlas world on port 4310, bound to `0.0.0.0`.
- `npm run app:start`: detached preview of the built app and API, bound to `0.0.0.0`;
  run from a human terminal. Access it through localhost or a host network address on port 4310.
- `npm run app:stop`, `app:restart`, `app:status`: manage that detached preview.
  Restart preserves its port. See `RUNNING.md`.
- `npm run app:build`: layout tests, then type-checks and bundles the app to `web/dist/`.
- `npm run app:update`: `app:build`, `app:restart` and `native:build`, after merging to `main` (see above).
- `npm run app:typecheck`: checks React, API and Atlas TypeScript.
- `npm run app:e2e`: browser tests of the Atlas against a mocked fleet (no daemon is reached).
- `npm run native:build`, `native:run [-- --url …]`: the macOS app (`native/`) that draws the Atlas with
  SpriteKit under the React app in a WKWebView; `native:mock` serves web/dist with a mocked fleet. See `native/README.md`.
  The app starts the app server itself (`app:start` on its URL's port) when it isn't running, and again if it stops;
  the server keeps running after the app quits. Check runs pass `--no-server`.
  Launch it with `open -g` and `--background` for checks; it must never take the user's focus.
- `npm run render:test`: layout and tile tests.

The earlier cached Phaser AE prototype in `game/` (with `npm run build`, `smoke`, `play`, `serve`)
is no longer used by the app. Any publishing, asset-upload, crew or account instructions in its
generated engine documentation are superseded by the user’s local-only requirements above.
Local assets belong in the repository and are included through local build tooling.

## Structure

- `rendering/src/world.ts`: Atlas vocabulary, axial geometry and the deterministic fleet layout.
- `rendering/src/placement.ts`, `camera.ts`, `outline.ts`, `pick.ts`, `ribbon.ts`: where structures, props,
  flags, banners, tiles and robots stand, and the camera, outline and picking rules (ported to Swift).
- `rendering/src/art.ts`, `terrain.ts`: the sprite frames and the painted sea, landmasses and islands.
- `rendering/src/atlas.ts`: `mountAtlas(parent, handlers)`, the embedding API (null outside the macOS app).
- `rendering/src/sample.ts`: illustrative fleets for the layout tests.
- `web/src/NativeWorld.tsx`: maps the React app's host-qualified world snapshot to the Atlas,
  forwards map picks as selections and draws app selections on the map.
- `web/server/`: inherited official Paseo SDK API, served with the app on all interfaces.
- `web/e2e/`: browser tests with every `/api` request answered in the browser.
- `web/src/Dispatch.tsx` `NewAgent`: a new agent opens in the panel as an empty conversation (host, where and
  branch in a small form) with the usual composer; its first message creates the agent. Its /skills and @files
  come from `GET /api/drafts/commands|files` (`web/server/api/drafts.ts`), as no agent exists yet.
- `rendering/src/native/bridge.ts`: inside the native app, the Atlas world `mountAtlas` returns: it lays out and paints
  with the shared modules (`placement.ts`, `art.ts`, `terrain.ts`) and posts the result to Swift (`native/Sources/`),
  which draws, animates and owns camera, hover and picking under a transparent page.
- `web/src/AddProject.tsx`: the Projects tab's Add project panel. On a chosen host, browse its folders
  (`GET /api/folders`, folder names only) and register the open folder, make a new folder in it, or clone a
  pasted GitHub repo into it (`web/server/api/projects.ts`); New agent then opens on the new project.
- `web/src/urlState.ts`: the panel's place (selection, subagent, tab, filter, host filter, list toggle) kept in
  the page's query, so a refresh returns there; a new selection pushes history, other changes replace it.

## Atlas world

The app bundles `rendering/` directly; the bridge paints its art in the page and SpriteKit draws it.
Each project with workspaces is its own island (projects without workspaces are hidden, as are hosts without any; if no host has workspaces, each shows as a bare clearing): a ten-hex
landmark (rows of 3, 4, 3) in the middle, ringed by its workspaces, each touching it. Workspaces are placed
bottom, lower-left, lower-right, upper-left, upper-right, then top, a cell apart (later ones stand against
that ring). A workspace is a three-hex timber triangle pointing at the landmark, its cottage larger and centred
across all three. Each agent is a robot on its own light-tiled hex beside its workspace, growing away from
the landmark, oldest first: straight out, then alternating left and right. Islands are only these built cells:
no empty sand around them (the user removed it). A host's islands share one landmass of grass hex tiles (hexes everywhere) with a hex-edged shore in a generated sea, under the host's
banner (offline hosts are faded and labeled). Each agent's state shows only on its sand hex (fill, border colour, border motion: a light runs round
running borders, states that need you pulse); robots carry no rings or badges. Hosts, projects, workspaces and
agents each have their own hover border colour; hosts are not interactive on the map (no hover, no pick from land or banner). The user asked for water back (rejecting chart paper, and a plain meadow background), with each
host as a landmass; project islands sit on it on earthen banks with soft shadows.
The layout follows the map's aspect ratio: hosts shelf-pack and tall maps stack vertically.
Agents the daemon reports without a workspace wait at a flagged camp, laid out like a workspace.
Each landmark's paving carries props (`props.png`): a seeded mix of greenery and workshop gear, two lamps
lit while any of the project's agents is running, and a beacon that flares, in the most urgent state's colour,
when one needs approval, has a question or failed. Props keep off the landmark's art, its name and the kerb.
The world is assembled from generated transparent sprite atlases, a terrain texture,
and a strict axial hex grid. It is not a screenshot used as a background.
The sea's glints and cloud shadows drift slowly in 15 Hz steps. The world renders on demand: 30 fps for ambient
motion, full rate while handled, paused when nothing moves or the window is hidden.
The inherited React UI is preserved; its panels use the Galaxy theme, as in the user's reference.
Five original references are retained in `design/references/atlas-01.webp` through `atlas-05.webp`.
Artwork provenance and generation prompts are in `rendering/ASSETS.md`.
Architecture uses the original `buildings.png` plus `structures.png`: eight project landmarks
and seven workspace cottages, balanced deterministically across neighbours (`STRUCTURE_SAMPLE` in the tests).

## Confirmed map constraints

Labels stay at fixed world scale. Do not add screen-size compensation.
All structures and scenery consume whole cells on the shared axial grid.
Workspaces use three hexes; project landmarks use ten (rows of 3, 4 and 3); each agent uses one.
One island per project with workspaces.
Center artwork and fit it completely inside its occupied cells.
Selection follows the outer perimeter of the occupied hexes, never a rectangle: a golden rim with a breathing
yellow halo over a warm wash, so the selected entity reads on any surface. Hover and selection
rims are inset within the cells so painted kerbs and banks never clip them; an agent hovers across its whole cell.
Hosts are picked from the Hosts tab only (land and banner are not interactive): the map rings its landmass and the lists narrow to it, the same
host filter as the Hosts tab; any other selection takes the highlight while it lasts.
Project, workspace and agent cells each have a distinct tile style (flagstones, timber decking, light sand
tiles); islands have no empty cells. Minimum zoom fits the land with a one-cell border (plus room for banners and map controls);
panning stays within that extent. The world never sends daemon actions; the React UI owns them.
